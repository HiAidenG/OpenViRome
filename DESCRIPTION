Description: OpenViRome is an R package designed to generate 'virome reports' of
             Serratus data given a taxonomic group of interest. Its primary focus 
             is on generating meaningful and interpretable plots of viral 
             diversity for streamlined analysis, not the generation of new data.
             It is meant to be used in tandem with palmid, which provides a 
             contrasting 'virus-first' approach. OpenViRome can take as input a 
             taxonomic group of interest, or a vector of SRA run ids that have 
             been queried by Serratus.
